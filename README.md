## Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Tracking using SLR  
### Space Infrastructure Thesis

This repository explores a **Space Situational Awareness (SSA)** thesis focused on **Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR)** as a high-precision, cost-efficient alternative for orbital tracking.

### Context
Low-Earth orbit is becoming increasingly congested, while India and APAC lack sovereign, high-precision SSA infrastructure. Current solutions are either:
- Expensive satellite-based systems, or
- Low-precision radar and optical ground networks

### Core Thesis
SLR offers a compelling middle ground:
- Centimeter-level orbital accuracy
- Lower CAPEX than satellite-based SSA
- Strong fit with India’s sovereign space ambitions

### What this covers
- SSA tracking methods comparison
- Why SLR is under-adopted in APAC
- Market sizing (India + APAC)
- Competitive landscape
- Ideal customer profiles (ISRO, defense, insurers, operators)
- Risks and mitigation strategies

### Key Insight
India-led SLR networks can become **strategic orbital safety infrastructure** with recurring revenue and strong regulatory tailwinds.
